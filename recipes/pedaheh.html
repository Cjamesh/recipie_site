        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            Pedaheh (better known as perogis) have been a tradition in my family for about as long as I can remember. We would go over to my grandmother's house nearly every year
            a week or so before Epiphay (or as we called it "Ukranian Christmas") to make them. The are delicious, but definitely not good for you.
        </p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups of flour, plus more for flouring</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>6 Tbsp butter, plus more for serving</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>

                <li>3 yellow onions</li>

        <h1>Preperation</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour and salt in a bowl</li>
            <li>Heat 1/2 cup of water and 3 Tbsp butter until melted, then pour butter mixture into flour mixture while stirring</li>
            <li>Stir in egg</li>
            <li>Knead dough until smooth, then cover with damp towel and rest for 30 minutes</li>
            <li>While dough is resting, peel potatoes and cut into cubes</li>
            <li>Add potatoes to a large pot of salted water and boil until potatoes are tender</li>
            <li>While potatoes are cooking, melt 3 more Tbsp butter and add chopped onions and season with salt and pepper</li>
            <li>When potatoes are done, mash</li>
            <li>Once dough is ready, roll out and use glass to cut equal circles out of the dough</li>
            <li>Fill the perogis by putting a small amount of potatoes, onions, and cheese onto one half of each circle, then close and crimp the edges</li>
            <li>In a large pot of boiling water, work in small batches by putting the perogis in and boil for about 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Once all perogis are done boiling, prepare a buttered pan and again work in batches to pan fry perogis until they are golden brown on each side</li>
            <li>Serve hot with butter, onions and sour cream</li>
        </ol>
