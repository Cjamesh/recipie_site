        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This recipe is as close as I can remember to a salsa recipe I was taught ages ago by my aunt. The fire roasted tomatoes are really what give
            it a great taste. Some things have been tweaked to my liking, but overall its really not that hard to make a good salsa. This is best paired with
            a really good chip, don't skimp out on that aspect. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In my opinion, the smoking adds a lot of flavor, but honestly if you really wanted to, you could leave it out. Another option is to roast the onions and peppers
            on a stovetop, grill, or oven before hand. That would still give it that smokey flavor.
